    <h2>The Complete History of Nigeria</h2>
    <p>
      Discover the fascinating story of Nigeria ‚Äî from the ancient kingdoms that shaped its identity,
      through colonial struggles, independence, civil war, and into the modern era of progress and innovation.
      This is the journey of a nation with deep roots and unstoppable spirit.
    </p>

  <section id="pre-colonial" class="container">
    <h2>Pre-Colonial Nigeria</h2>
    <p>
      Nigeria‚Äôs pre-colonial era was home to great civilizations such as Nok, Ife, Benin, and Oyo ‚Äî societies known
      for art, trade, and sophisticated systems of governance long before European contact. The Nok civilization,
      dating as far back as 1000 BC, was among the earliest in West Africa, renowned for terracotta sculptures
      that captured both human and animal figures in striking detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the southwest, the Oyo Empire thrived between the 14th and 18th centuries, wielding immense political and
      military power. The empire‚Äôs system of government included the Alaafin (king) and the Oyo Mesi (council of chiefs),
      forming one of the earliest models of checks and balances in African governance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the Benin Kingdom became a center of art and innovation. The Benin Bronzes, intricate metal plaques and
      sculptures, showcased an advanced knowledge of metallurgy and depicted royal life, ceremonies, and historical
      events. The city itself was surrounded by an elaborate system of walls ‚Äî one of the largest man-made structures in the world.

  <section id="colonial" class="container">
    <h2>Colonial Nigeria</h2>
    <p>
      By the late 19th century, Britain had extended its control across much of West Africa. Nigeria officially became
      a British colony in 1914 when the Northern and Southern Protectorates were amalgamated. The system of indirect rule,
      popularized by Lord Lugard, allowed traditional rulers to govern locally under British supervision.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this reduced the cost of administration, it sowed divisions by favoring some regions over others.
      Infrastructure like railways and roads were built primarily to extract natural resources such as palm oil and cocoa,
      enriching Britain while impoverishing Nigerians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, education introduced by Christian missionaries gave rise to a new class of Nigerians ‚Äî literate, ambitious,
      and eager for self-rule. By the 1940s, nationalist movements gained strength under leaders like Nnamdi Azikiwe,
      Obafemi Awolowo, and Ahmadu Bello, uniting Nigerians toward independence.

  <section id="independence" class="container">
    <h2>Independence and Nationhood</h2>
    <p>
      Nigeria achieved independence on October 1, 1960 ‚Äî a moment celebrated with joy and hope across the land.
      The green-white-green flag symbolized agriculture, peace, and unity. Sir Nnamdi Azikiwe became the first Governor-General,
      and Alhaji Tafawa Balewa served as Prime Minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      But unity proved challenging. Ethnic and regional rivalries emerged, and differing political ideologies
      created tension. In 1966, military coups shattered Nigeria‚Äôs first republic, setting the stage for civil conflict.

  <section id="civil-war" class="container">
    <h2>The Nigerian Civil War (1967‚Äì1970)</h2>
    <p>
      When the Eastern Region declared itself the Republic of Biafra under Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu, Nigeria descended into
      a brutal civil war. Millions suffered from famine and displacement. The conflict lasted for nearly three years before
      Biafra surrendered in January 1970.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the devastation, post-war Nigeria adopted the motto ‚ÄúNo Victor, No Vanquished,‚Äù emphasizing reconciliation.
      The government invested in rebuilding efforts, although the scars of the war still echo in modern times.

  <section id="modern-nigeria" class="container">
    <h2>Modern Nigeria</h2>
    <p>
      Nigeria returned to civilian rule in 1999 after decades of military regimes. With democracy came hope for economic growth
      and international influence. Nigeria became Africa‚Äôs largest economy, driven by oil, agriculture, and entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, corruption, poverty, and insecurity remain challenges. Still, Nigeria‚Äôs people continue to show resilience.
      Nollywood, Afrobeat, and the energy of its youth have made Nigeria a global cultural powerhouse.

    <h2>Nigeria‚Äôs Rise as Africa‚Äôs Tech Hub</h2>
    <p>
      In the 21st century, Nigeria has become the heartbeat of Africa‚Äôs digital revolution.
      Startups like Paystack, Flutterwave, and Andela have placed Nigeria at the forefront of innovation.
      With over 200 million citizens ‚Äî most of them under 30 ‚Äî the nation‚Äôs youth are turning technology into opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lagos, often called ‚ÄúAfrica‚Äôs Silicon Valley,‚Äù hosts thousands of startups and tech labs.
      Nigerian fintech has enabled millions of unbanked citizens to access financial services, empowering
      small businesses and fueling economic inclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      International investors now see Nigeria not only as a resource-rich nation but also as a home for creativity,
      technology, and entrepreneurship that can transform the continent.
